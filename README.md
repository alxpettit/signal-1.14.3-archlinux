# signal-1.14.3-archlinux
Downgraded package for Signal 1.14.3 because of the HORRIBLE LAG REGRESSION in 1.15. Please get on fixing that my peeps. Also, what is up with Signal deleting the 1.14.3 .deb file from their Ubuntu repo so that the earlier PKGBUILD is broken now?

whisper systems pls fix ur stuff this is embarassing
